## Description
I created a vehicle builder that can create or choose existing vehicles. Your selection will prompt details about the vehicle, it can be a car, truck, or motorbike. Users can find out specific details and wether the truck can tow another vehicle or if a motorbike can do a wheelie. The users can perform actions with their selected vehicle.
